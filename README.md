# ALWA

## S1.Metamaterial Acoustic Leaky Wave Antennas (ALWA) - Lumped Element Analysis

### Summary



This code is designed to study ALWAs, based on the theory of composite right left handed materials (CRLH), and is developed for Octave scientific programming language (fully compatible with MATLAB).

The project is part of an educational open source kit for the evaluation of acoustic leaky wave antennas with metamaterials, published on the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.
